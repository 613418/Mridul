Various sources of Big Data are:
Archives, Docs, Media, Data Storage, Business Apps, Public Web, Social Media, Sensor Data

3 V's of Big Data:
Variety, Velocity and Volume
Variety:Different type of data refer to variety like Pure text, photo, audio, video, web, GPS data, sensor data, relational data bases,
        documents, SMS, pdf, flash, etc 
Velocity: The rate at which data is traversing.
Volume: The size of available data has been growing at an increasing rate. A text file is a few kilo bytes,
        a sound file is a few mega bytes while a full length movie is a few giga bytes.

Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling:
Horizontal scaling: Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources.
Vertical scaling: Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.

Need and Working of Hadoop:
To store large amount of data. Compare to the other working platform hadoop can store large amount of data.
The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of
computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local
computation and storage.
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): The storage system for Hadoop spread out over multiple machines as a means to reduce cost and
                                       increase reliability.
MapReduce engine: The algorithm that filters, sorts and then uses the database input in some way.
